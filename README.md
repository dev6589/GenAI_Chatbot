# GenAI_Chatbot

Welcome to the repository for GenAI_Chatbot, a cutting-edge chatbot powered by the Llama GGUF model and utilizing a Retriever-Generator (RAG) based LLM (Large Language Model) approach. This chatbot allows users to upload documents and interactively ask questions about their contents, leveraging the capabilities of advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Features

- **Document Understanding**: Upload any document, and the chatbot will understand and index its content.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions based on the content of the uploaded document, receiving answers generated by the chatbot.
- **Powered by Llama GGUF**: Utilizes the Llama GGUF model for understanding and generating responses.
- **Hugging Face Integration**: Built using libraries from Hugging Face, ensuring cutting-edge performance and up-to-date models.

## How It Works

The GenAI_Chatbot operates using a two-step process:
1. **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents in various formats. The chatbot processes and tokenizes the document, preparing it for querying.
2. **Query Processing**: Utilizing a RAG-based LLM approach, the chatbot retrieves information relevant to user queries from the document and generates coherent and contextually accurate responses.
